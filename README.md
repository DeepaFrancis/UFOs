# *UFOs*

*We are creatibg a webpage to display UFO sightings around the world from a dataset.*

## *Resources*

- *HTML*
- *CSS*
- *Visual Studio Code*
- *Google Chrome*
- *JavaScript*
- *Bootstrap*

## *Overview*

*A person can search for UFO sighting(s) by filtering on date, city, state, country, and shape. The table displays results according to user input. The following pictures represent how the webpage works.*

## *Summary*

### *Drawback*
*With the current webpage, its not easy for a user to find the UFO sighting details if they don't know the dataset. A drop-down menu with prepopulated data set will help the user to use the webpage easily.*

### *Future development recommendation*

- *Creating and placing a "Clear" button in the "Filter Search" form as opposed to using the "UFO sightings".*
- *drop-down menu in each filter to allow the user to select a choice within the menu.*
